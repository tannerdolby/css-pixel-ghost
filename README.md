# Ghost Pixel art
I created this pixel ghost on a pixel drawing app [PxL](https://pxl.netlify.app/) created by [@jh3y](https://github.com/jh3y). The pixel art is available in SVG, PNG, and CSS variable formats. I animated the ghosts eyes to move slightly using CSS Keyframes, to then create a GIF with.
